# ImageClassification with Neural Network \n 
# Data description
# Data description
<mark> The dataset Natural_images is downloaded form kaggle. Source of the dataset is https://www.kaggle.com/prasunroy/natural-images.
- <mark> There are 6899 images in the datasets of 8 different classes. The 8 different classes are : 'airplane', 'car', 'cat', 'dog', 'flower', 'fruit', 'motorbike' and'person'
# Objectives
<mark> Here we will build two models i.e. dense layer model and convolutional layered model and make comparisions. We will try to find, which model does better for this dataset.
